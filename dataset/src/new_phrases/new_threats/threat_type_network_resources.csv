PLTT;Electromagnetic Interference (EMI);Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a type of interference that can occur in IoT networks when electromagnetic waves from one device interfere with the operation of another device. This interference can cause data corruption, data loss, and other issues that can impact the reliability and performance of IoT networks. EMI can be caused by a variety of sources, including power lines, motors, and other electronic devices. To mitigate the risk of EMI in IoT networks, it is important to design devices and networks with appropriate shielding and grounding to minimize the impact of electromagnetic waves. Additionally, IoT devices should be tested to ensure that they are not emitting excessive electromagnetic radiation that could interfere with other devices. Finally, IoT networks should be designed with redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure that data can be rerouted in the event of interference or other disruptions to network functionality.;Smolenski, R., 2012. Conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) in smart grids. Springer Science & Business Media.
NTT;Extreme Temperatures;Extreme temperatures can be a threat to IoT network resources. IoT devices may not be designed to operate in extreme temperatures, and exposure to high or low temperatures can cause device malfunction or failure. For example, high temperatures can cause electronic components to overheat and fail, while low temperatures can cause battery life to shorten or devices to freeze up. To mitigate this risk, IoT devices should be designed to operate within a specific range of temperatures, and organizations should ensure that devices are not exposed to extreme temperatures outside of this range. Additionally, devices can be housed in protective enclosures or placed in temperature-controlled environments to minimize the risk of temperature-related damage.;Ikpehai, A., Adebisi, B., Rabie, K.M., Anoh, K., Ande, R.E., Hammoudeh, M., Gacanin, H. and Mbanaso, U.M., 2018.

NTT;Floods;Floods can damage or destroy IoT devices and disrupt network connectivity.;
NTT;Lightning strikes;Lightning strikes can be a significant threat to IoT network resources. Lightning strikes can cause power surges or electrical discharges that can damage or destroy electronic devices, including IoT devices. Additionally, lightning strikes can cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can disrupt or corrupt data transmissions between IoT devices. To mitigate this risk, IoT devices should be designed with appropriate surge protection and grounding mechanisms to protect against lightning strikes. Additionally, organizations should ensure that IoT devices are not installed in areas where they are likely to be struck by lightning, and should have contingency plans in place to deal with potential disruptions to IoT device functionality caused by lightning strikes or other extreme weather events.;Mialdea-Flor, I., Segura-Garcia, J., Felici-Castell, S., Garcia-Pineda, M., Alcaraz-Calero, J.M. and Navarro-Camba, E., 2019. Development of a low-cost IoT system for lightning strike detection and location. Electronics, 8(12), p.1512.
HTT;Battery Low;Power failures can cause IoT devices to shut down or malfunction, leading to data loss or corruption.;
HTT;Hardware Failure;Hardware failure is a common threat to IoT network resources. It can occur due to various reasons, such as manufacturing defects, wear and tear, and environmental factors. When hardware fails, it can cause IoT devices to malfunction, leading to data loss, reduced performance, and even complete failure. For example, if a sensor or other IoT device fails to communicate with the network due to hardware failure, it can cause a disruption in the data flow, leading to incorrect or missing information. Similarly, if a device's power supply or battery fails, it can cause the device to shut down, leading to data loss or other issues. To mitigate the risk of hardware failure, IoT developers should design devices with high-quality components and perform rigorous testing to ensure their reliability. Additionally, organizations should have contingency plans in place to quickly replace or repair failed devices to minimize disruptions to the network.;Abed, S.E., Jaffal, R. and Mohd, B.J., 2023. A Review on Blockchain and IoT Integration from Energy, Security and Hardware Perspectives. Wireless Personal Communications, 129(3), pp.2079-2122.
HTT;Firmware Vulnerabilities;Firmware vulnerabilities can pose a significant threat to IoT network resources. Firmware is the software that is embedded in the IoT device's hardware, and it controls the device's functionality. If the firmware has vulnerabilities, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the device, steal data, or use the device as a launching pad to attack other devices on the network. These vulnerabilities can arise from coding errors, design flaws, or failure to apply security patches and updates. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by reverse engineering the firmware or using known exploits to gain access to the device. Once they gain access, they can modify the firmware to take control of the device, steal data, or launch attacks on other devices on the network. To mitigate the risk of firmware vulnerabilities, IoT developers should follow secure coding practices, perform regular security testing, and apply security patches and updates promptly. Additionally, IoT devices should be designed with secure boot mechanisms to ensure that only authorized firmware can be loaded onto the device. Organizations should also have a process in place to quickly identify and respond to firmware vulnerabilities to minimize the risk of exploitation.;Arakadakis, K., Charalampidis, P., Makrogiannakis, A. and Fragkiadakis, A., 2021. Firmware over-the-air programming techniques for IoT networks-a survey. ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 54(9), pp.1-36.
NLTT;Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks;MitM attacks can intercept and manipulate data traffic between IoT devices, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data or launch further attacks.;
NLTT;Network Errors;Network congestion can slow down or disrupt the communication between IoT devices, leading to reduced performance and functionality.;
ALTT;SQL injection attacks;SQL injection attacks are a type of cyber threat that can affect IoT network resources. In a SQL injection attack, a malicious actor exploits vulnerabilities in a web application or device's software to inject malicious SQL code into a database. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, and even take control of the affected device. In the context of IoT, SQL injection attacks can be particularly dangerous because many IoT devices rely on web applications and databases to function. For example, a smart home system might use a web application to allow users to control their devices, and if this system is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, an attacker could potentially gain access to the user's home network and connected devices. To mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, IoT developers should follow secure coding practices, such as validating user input and using parameterized queries. Additionally, organizations should regularly test their IoT devices and web applications for vulnerabilities and apply security patches as soon as they become available.;Clarke, J., 2009. SQL injection attacks and defense. Elsevier.
ALTT;Cross-site scripting attacks;Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks can be a threat to IoT network resources. XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a web page viewed by another user, usually by exploiting a vulnerability in the website's code. When the victim views the page, the malicious code is executed, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the victim's device. In the context of IoT, XSS attacks can occur when web interfaces used to control IoT devices are vulnerable to injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious code into these interfaces, allowing them to take control of the device or steal sensitive information. To mitigate this threat, IoT developers should ensure that web interfaces are designed with security in mind and that input validation is performed to prevent injection attacks. Additionally, users should be educated on the risks of clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from untrusted sources.;Grossman, J., Fogie, S., Hansen, R., Rager, A. and Petkov, P.D., 2007. XSS attacks: cross site scripting exploits and defense. Syngress.
PLTT;Vibration and Shock;Vibration and shock can be a significant threat to IoT network resources, especially for devices that are deployed in harsh environments or are subject to frequent movement or impact. Vibrations and shocks can cause physical damage to the hardware components of IoT devices, leading to malfunction or failure. For example, excessive vibration can cause components to loosen or detach, leading to electrical shorts or other issues. To mitigate this threat, IoT developers should design devices with appropriate shock and vibration resistance and perform rigorous testing to ensure their reliability. They should also consider using shock-absorbing materials and techniques to protect sensitive components from damage. Additionally, organizations should regularly inspect and maintain IoT devices to ensure they remain in good working condition and replace any damaged devices promptly.;Khademi, A., Raji, F. and Sadeghi, M., 2019, April. IoT enabled vibration monitoring toward smart maintenance. In 2019 3rd International Conference on Internet of Things and Applications (IoT) (pp. 1-6). IEEE.
NTT;Earthquakes;Earthquakes can damage IoT sensors and cause them to malfunction or fail completely.;
HTT;Power Supply Failure;Power supply failure is a significant threat to IoT network resources. IoT devices rely on a stable and reliable power source to function correctly. Power supply failure can lead to data loss, reduced performance, and even complete device failure. In some cases, power supply failure can also damage the hardware components of IoT devices, leading to costly repairs or replacements. To mitigate this threat, IoT developers should design devices with appropriate power management and backup systems. For example, devices can be designed to switch to battery power in the event of a power outage or use redundant power supplies to ensure continuity of service. Additionally, organizations should regularly test and maintain their power infrastructure to ensure it is reliable and can handle the demands of their IoT devices. They should also have contingency plans in place to quickly replace or repair failed power supplies to minimize disruptions to the network.;Yadav, E.P., Mittal, E.A. and Yadav, H., 2018, February. IoT: Challenges and issues in indian perspective. In 2018 3rd International Conference On Internet of Things: Smart Innovation and Usages (IoT-SIU) (pp. 1-5). IEEE.
HTT;Component Failure;Component failure is one of the most common threats to IoT network resources. This refers to the failure of hardware components such as sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and other electronic components that are used in IoT devices. Component failure can occur due to a variety of reasons, including manufacturing defects, wear and tear, environmental factors, and power surges. When a component fails, it can cause the entire IoT device or network to malfunction, leading to data loss, reduced performance, and even complete failure. To mitigate the risk of component failure, IoT developers should use high-quality components, perform rigorous testing, and have contingency plans in place to quickly replace or repair failed devices. Additionally, organizations should regularly test and maintain their IoT devices to ensure they are functioning properly and can handle the demands of their network.;Oteafy, S.M. and Hassanein, H.S., 2016. Resilient IoT architectures over dynamic sensor networks with adaptive components. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 4(2), pp.474-483.
NLTT;Packet Sniffing;Packet sniffing is a type of cyber attack that involves intercepting and analyzing network traffic to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. In the context of IoT networks, packet sniffing can be used to intercept and analyze the communication between IoT devices and the network, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, and other confidential data. Packet sniffing can be particularly dangerous for IoT networks because many IoT devices are designed to send data over unencrypted channels, making them vulnerable to interception and analysis. To mitigate the risk of packet sniffing, IoT developers should use secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS, to encrypt data in transit. Additionally, organizations should regularly monitor their network traffic for signs of packet sniffing and other cyber attacks and have contingency plans in place to quickly respond to any security incidents.;Diyeb, I.A.I., Saif, A. and Al-Shaibany, N.A., 2018. Ethical network surveillance using packet sniffing tools: A comparative study. International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security, 11(7), p.12.
ALTT;Zero-Day Exploits;A zero-day exploit is a type of cyber attack that takes advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware. This vulnerability can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, steal data, or launch other types of attacks. In the context of IoT network resources, a zero-day exploit could be used to target a specific IoT device, take control of it, and use it for malicious purposes. For example, an attacker could use a zero-day exploit to take control of a smart thermostat and manipulate its temperature settings, causing discomfort or even physical harm to the occupants of a building. To mitigate the risk of zero-day exploits, IoT developers should regularly update their devices with the latest security patches and firmware updates, and organizations should implement network-level security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems to detect and block malicious traffic.;Wang, L., Zhang, M., Jajodia, S., Singhal, A. and Albanese, M., 2014. Modeling network diversity for evaluating the robustness of networks against zero-day attacks. In Computer Security-ESORICS 2014: 19th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, Wroclaw, Poland, September 7-11, 2014. Proceedings, Part II 19 (pp. 494-511). Springer International Publishing.
PLTT;Physical Damage;Physical damage is a threat to IoT network resources that can occur due to various reasons, such as natural disasters, accidents, or deliberate attacks. Physical damage can cause IoT devices to malfunction, leading to data loss, reduced performance, and even complete failure. For example, a flood or earthquake can damage the physical infrastructure supporting an IoT network, such as power lines or communication cables, leading to a loss of connectivity. Similarly, a deliberate attack, such as tampering with a device's hardware, can cause it to malfunction or become completely inoperable. To mitigate the risk of physical damage, IoT developers should design devices that are robust and resistant to physical damage, such as using durable materials and protective casings. Organizations should also have contingency plans in place to quickly replace or repair failed devices, and regularly test and maintain their power infrastructure to ensure it is reliable and can handle the demands of their IoT devices. Additionally, organizations should consider implementing physical security measures, such as access controls and surveillance systems, to prevent unauthorized access to their IoT devices and infrastructure.;
NLTT;Eavesdropping and traffic analysis;Eavesdropping or interception of wireless communication between IoT devices.;
PLTT;Signal Interference;Interference or disruption of wireless communication due to natural phenomena such as lightning or solar flares;
PLTT;Unauthorized Access;"Unauthorized access to IoT devices through hardware interfaces such as USB or Ethernet ports; Unauthorized access to network resources through vulnerabilities in network protocols or configurations";
ALTT;Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attacks;Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks are a significant threat to IoT network resources. In an RCE attack, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the IoT device's firmware or software to execute malicious code remotely, giving them complete control over the device. Once an attacker gains control of an IoT device, they can use it to launch further attacks against other devices on the network or use it as a platform for launching attacks against external targets. RCE attacks can be devastating to IoT networks, as they can allow attackers to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, and cause physical damage to devices. To mitigate the risks of RCE attacks, IoT developers should implement secure coding practices, perform regular firmware updates and patches, and use network segmentation to isolate IoT devices from other network resources. Organizations should also monitor their networks for suspicious activity and have incident response plans in place to quickly respond to RCE attacks.;Everson, D., Cheng, L. and Zhang, Z., 2022. Log4shell: Redefining the web attack surface. In Workshop on Measurements, Attacks, and Defenses for the Web (MADWeb) 2022.
PLTT;Jamming;Attackers can flood the network with traffic, which can result in denial of service and disrupt communication between IoT devices. This can lead to loss of data and functionality of the IoT network.;
