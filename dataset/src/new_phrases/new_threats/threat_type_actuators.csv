PLTT;Tempering;An attacker may physically tamper with the IoT actuator to gain unauthorized access or to disable it.;
PLTT;Theft;Theft can be a significant threat to IoT actuators as they are often used to control physical devices or machinery. If an attacker gains access to an IoT actuator, they can manipulate it to cause damage or steal valuable equipment. For example, an attacker could use a compromised actuator to shut down a production line or cause a malfunction in a critical system, leading to significant financial losses. Additionally, if the actuator is stolen, it can be reprogrammed and used for malicious purposes, such as controlling other IoT devices or launching cyber attacks. To mitigate this threat, it's essential to secure IoT actuators physically and ensure that they are only accessible to authorized personnel. This can be done by implementing access controls, monitoring usage, and installing security cameras or alarms.;Chandrappa, D.R., Pavan, H.R., Sagar, M.V. and Dakshayini, M., 2018, March. Iot security solution to avoid theft. In 2018 International Conference on Wireless Communications, Signal Processing and Networking (WiSPNET) (pp. 1-3). IEEE.
NTT;Lightning Strikes;Lightning strikes can be a potential threat to IoT actuators. When a lightning strike occurs, it can generate a high voltage surge that can damage the electronic components of an IoT actuator, such as the controller, power supply, and communication interface. This can lead to the failure of the actuator and potentially cause safety hazards or financial losses. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to install surge protectors or lightning arresters between the IoT actuator and the power source or communication network. These devices can help to divert the high voltage surge away from the actuator and protect it from damage. Additionally, it is important to regularly inspect and maintain the surge protection devices to ensure their effectiveness.;Mialdea-Flor, I., Segura-Garcia, J., Felici-Castell, S., Garcia-Pineda, M., Alcaraz-Calero, J.M. and Navarro-Camba, E., 2019. Development of a low-cost IoT system for lightning strike detection and location. Electronics, 8(12), p.1512.
NTT;Landslides;Landslides can pose a threat to IoT actuators in a few ways. First, if an IoT actuator is installed in an area that is at risk of landslides, the physical infrastructure supporting the actuator could be damaged or destroyed by the landslide. This could cause the actuator to malfunction or become inoperable. Second, if the landslide causes a power outage, the IoT actuator may not be able to function due to a lack of power. Finally, if the landslide damages the network infrastructure that the IoT actuator relies on to communicate with other devices, the actuator may not be able to transmit data or receive commands. All of these factors could potentially impact the effectiveness and reliability of IoT actuators in landslide-prone areas.;Oguz, E.A., Robinson, K., Depina, I. and Thakur, V., 2019, December. IoT-based strategies for risk management of rainfall-induced landslides: a review. In Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Geotechnical Safety and Risk (ISGSR 2019), Taipei, Taiwan (pp. 11-13).
NTT;Tornadoes;Tornadoes can also be a potential threat to IoT actuators. Tornadoes can generate strong winds and debris that can damage or destroy IoT devices and their associated infrastructure, such as power lines and communication networks. In addition, tornadoes can also cause power outages, which can disrupt the operation of IoT devices that rely on electricity. To mitigate the impact of tornadoes on IoT devices, it is important to consider the location and installation of the devices, as well as the use of backup power sources and robust communication networks.;Liu, Y., Wang, K., Qian, K., Du, M. and Guo, S., 2019. Tornado: Enabling blockchain in heterogeneous Internet of Things through a space-structured approach. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7(2), pp.1273-1286.
HTT;Cyberattacks;Cyberattacks pose a significant threat to IoT actuators. Because IoT actuators are typically connected to the internet and other devices, they can be vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats, including hacking, malware, and denial-of-service attacks. If an attacker gains access to an IoT actuator, they may be able to control its behavior, alter its settings, or even cause it to malfunction or shut down completely. This could have serious consequences, especially if the actuator is being used to control critical infrastructure or other important systems. To mitigate the risk of cyberattacks, it is important to implement strong security measures, such as using encryption and authentication protocols, regularly updating software and firmware, and monitoring network traffic for signs of suspicious activity. Additionally, it is important to train users and administrators on best practices for cybersecurity and to have a plan in place for responding to cyber incidents.;Stellios, I., Kotzanikolaou, P., Psarakis, M., Alcaraz, C. and Lopez, J., 2018. A survey of iot-enabled cyberattacks: Assessing attack paths to critical infrastructures and services. IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 20(4), pp.3453-3495.
HTT;Power Surges;Power surges can pose a threat to IoT actuators because they can damage or destroy the electronic components of the actuator. A power surge occurs when the voltage in an electrical circuit spikes above its normal level, which can happen due to lightning strikes, power outages, or other electrical disturbances. If an IoT actuator is not properly protected against power surges, a power surge could cause it to malfunction or become inoperable. To mitigate the risk of power surges, it is important to install surge protectors or uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) that can regulate and stabilize the voltage of the electrical circuit. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the IoT actuator is properly grounded and that all electrical connections are secure and well-maintained. By taking these steps, you can help to protect your IoT actuators from the damaging effects of power surges.;Antić, B., Bulat, M., Pejić, D., Gotovac, Z. and Mitrović, Z., 2023. Batteryless IoT module for sensing and signaling failures of passive power accessories. Microprocessors and Microsystems, 98, p.104809.
NLTT;Man in The Middle Attack;Attackers can intercept and modify communications between the IoT actuator and other devices, allowing them to eavesdrop or manipulate data.;
NLTT;DoS/DDoS in Network Layer;Attackers can flood the IoT actuator's network with traffic, causing it to become overwhelmed and unresponsive.;
NLTT;Packet Sniffing;Packet sniffing is a technique used to intercept and monitor network traffic. It can be a serious threat to IoT actuators because it allows an attacker to capture and analyze the data being sent between the actuators and other devices on the network. By doing so, the attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as login credentials or other data that could be used to compromise the security of the IoT system. In addition, packet sniffing can also be used to inject malicious packets into the network, which could cause the IoT actuators to malfunction or behave in unexpected ways. To mitigate this threat, it is important to use encryption and secure communication protocols to protect the data being transmitted between IoT devices.;Liu, X., Zeng, Q., Du, X., Valluru, S.L., Fu, C., Fu, X. and Luo, B., 2021, October. Sniffmislead: Non-intrusive privacy protection against wireless packet sniffers in smart homes. In Proceedings of the 24th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (pp. 33-47).
ALTT;Data Breaches;Data breaches can be a significant threat to IoT actuators. If a cybercriminal gains access to the data stored in an IoT actuator, they could potentially manipulate or control the device, causing it to perform actions that were not intended by the owner. This could lead to serious consequences, such as physical damage, financial loss, or even endangering human lives. In addition, a data breach could also result in the theft of sensitive information, such as personal or financial data, which could be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes. Therefore, it is essential to implement robust security measures to protect IoT actuators from data breaches.;Moganedi, S., 2018, June. Undetectable data breach in iot: Healthcare data at risk. In 17th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (Vol. 2, p. 296).
ALTT;Ransomware;Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's data and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. In the context of IoT actuators, ransomware can be a serious threat because it can effectively disable the actuators and prevent them from functioning properly. For example, an attacker could use ransomware to encrypt the data being sent to an IoT actuator controlling a critical system, such as a power grid or a hospital's life support system. This could cause significant disruption or even harm to individuals who depend on these systems. To mitigate this threat, it is important to implement strong security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware software, to prevent ransomware from infecting the IoT system. In addition, regular backups of critical data can be used to restore the system in the event of a ransomware attack.;Humayun, M., Jhanjhi, N.Z., Alsayat, A. and Ponnusamy, V., 2021. Internet of things and ransomware: Evolution, mitigation and prevention. Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22(1), pp.105-117.
ALTT;Zero-Day Exploits;Attackers can exploit unknown vulnerabilities in the IoT actuator's software, allowing them to gain unauthorized access or to cause it to malfunction.;Stellios, I., Kotzanikolaou, P. and Psarakis, M., 2019. Advanced persistent threats and zero-day exploits in industrial Internet of Things. Security and Privacy Trends in the Industrial Internet of Things, pp.47-68.
PLTT;Signal Interference;Attackers may use electromagnetic interference to disrupt the communication between the IoT actuator and the rest of the system.;
HTT;Supply Chain Attacks;Supply chain attacks are a type of cyber attack that targets the supply chain of a product or service. In the context of IoT actuators, supply chain attacks can be a serious threat because they can compromise the integrity of the components used in the actuators, thereby compromising the security and functionality of the entire system. For example, an attacker may compromise a supplier's manufacturing process to introduce a backdoor into the firmware of an IoT actuator, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to the system. To mitigate this threat, it is important to implement strong supply chain security measures, such as vetting suppliers and ensuring that they follow secure manufacturing processes. In addition, regular security audits of the IoT system can help detect any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity that may indicate a supply chain attack.;Omitola, T. and Wills, G., 2018. Towards mapping the security challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) supply chain. Procedia Computer Science, 126, pp.441-450.
HTT;Side-Channel Attacks;Side-channel attacks are a type of cyber attack that exploit weaknesses in a system's physical or electromagnetic emissions to extract sensitive information. In the context of IoT actuators, side-channel attacks can be a serious threat because they can be used to extract cryptographic keys or other sensitive information used to secure the system. For example, an attacker may use a power analysis attack to extract a secret key used to encrypt data transmitted by an IoT actuator. To mitigate this threat, it is important to implement strong cryptographic measures that are resistant to side-channel attacks, such as using randomized algorithms and implementing countermeasures like masking and blinding. In addition, physical security measures can be used to prevent attackers from gaining access to the device and its emissions, such as tamper-resistant packaging and secure storage.;Devi, M. and Majumder, A., 2021. Side-channel attack in Internet of Things: A survey. In Applications of Internet of Things: Proceedings of ICCCIOT 2020 (pp. 213-222). Springer Singapore.
ALTT;Malicious Scipts;Attackers may use XSS attacks to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the IoT actuator, allowing them to steal sensitive information or execute unauthorized commands.;
ALTT;Injection Attacks;Attackers may inject malicious code or data into the IoT actuator, causing it to execute unauthorized commands or behave in unexpected ways.;Panchal, A.C., Khadse, V.M. and Mahalle, P.N., 2018, November.

Employing blockchain and physical unclonable functions for counterfeit IoT devices detection. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Omni-Layer Intelligent Systems (pp. 172-178).
NLTT;Eavesdropping and Traffic Analysis;Attackers may monitor network traffic to intercept sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to IoT actuators.;
ALTT;Insider Attacks;Insider attacks are a type of threat to IoT actuators that occur when someone with authorized access to the system, such as an employee or contractor, intentionally or unintentionally misuses their access privileges to cause harm to the system or steal sensitive information. In the context of IoT actuators, insider attacks could involve an authorized user intentionally manipulating the actuators to cause damage to the system or steal data, or an unauthorized user gaining access to the system through an insider's credentials and carrying out similar actions. To mitigate the risk of insider attacks, it is important to implement strong access controls, regularly monitor user activity, and provide security awareness training to all employees and contractors with access to the system.;Khan, A.Y., Latif, R., Latif, S., Tahir, S., Batool, G. and Saba, T., 2019. Malicious insider attack detection in IoTs using data analytics. IEEE Access, 8, pp.11743-11753.
ALTT;SQL Injection;SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that can be a threat to IoT actuators. It occurs when an attacker sends malicious SQL commands to a database through an application that does not properly validate user input, allowing the attacker to execute unauthorized SQL commands and potentially gain access to sensitive data or control the actuators.  In the context of IoT actuators, an attacker could use SQL injection to manipulate the actuators to perform unauthorized actions, such as turning off critical systems or causing physical damage. To mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, it is important to implement secure coding practices, such as input validation and parameterized queries, and regularly update and patch software to address known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is important to implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the potential impact of a successful attack.;Uwagbole, S.O., Buchanan, W.J. and Fan, L., 2017, May. Applied machine learning predictive analytics to SQL injection attack detection and prevention. In 2017 IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management (IM) (pp. 1087-1090). IEEE.
ALTT;Remote Code Execution (RCE);Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a type of cyber attack that can be a threat to IoT actuators. It occurs when an attacker is able to execute arbitrary code on a remote system, allowing them to take control of the system and potentially manipulate the actuators connected to it. In the context of IoT actuators, an attacker could use RCE to execute code on a vulnerable device and manipulate the actuators to perform unauthorized actions, such as turning off critical systems or causing physical damage. To mitigate the risk of RCE attacks, it is important to implement secure coding practices, such as input validation and sanitization, and regularly update and patch software to address known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is important to implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the potential impact of a successful attack.;Bier, S., Fajardo, B., Ezeadum, O., Guzman, G., Sultana, K.Z. and Anu, V., 2021, April.
