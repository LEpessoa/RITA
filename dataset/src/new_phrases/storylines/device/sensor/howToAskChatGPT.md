## S Deensorfinition & Examples

ðŸš¨ Sensors:
Sensors provide information, knowledge, or data about the Physical Entity they
monitor. In this context, this ranges from the identity of the Physical Entity to
measures of the physical state of the Physical Entity. Like other Devices, they
can be attached or otherwise embedded in the physical structure of the Physical
Entity, or be placed in the environment and indirectly monitor Physical Entities.
An example for the latter is a face-recognition enabled camera. Information from
sensors can be recorded for later retrieval (e.g., in a storage of Resource);
Sensor is a special Device that measures physical characteristics of
one or more Physical Entities.

Give me an exhaustive list of Sensors capable of being integrated with Arduino.
