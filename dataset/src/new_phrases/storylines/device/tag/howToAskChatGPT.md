## Tag Definition & Examples
üö®Definition
Tags are labels or other physical objects used to identify the Physical Entity to which it is attached.Tags are used to identify Physical Entities, to which the Tags are usually physically attached. The identification process is called ‚Äúreading‚Äù, and it is carried out by specific Sensor Devices, which are usually called readers. The primary purpose of Tags is to facilitate and increase the accuracy of the identification process. This process can be optical, as in the case of barcodes and QR codes, or it can be RF-based, as in the case of microwave car-plate recognition systems and RFID.

Tags are a type of IoT devices.

Give me an exhaustive list of IoT tags?
Tags can be used in IoT applications for various purposes such as tracking, inventory management, asset management, and more. Here are some examples of IoT tags:

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags
NFC (Near Field Communication) tags
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags
GPS (Global Positioning System) tags
QR (Quick Response) code tags
Barcodes tags
Magnetic tags
Active RFID tags
Passive RFID tags
Electronic article surveillance (EAS) tags
Wi-Fi tags
Zigbee tags
LoRa tags
UWB (Ultra-Wideband) tags
Smart labels
Sensor tags
It's important to note that there are many different types of IoT tags, and their applications and specifications may vary depending on the use case. Some tags may be suitable for tracking large objects or vehicles, while others may be designed for tracking smaller items or people. The choice of tag depends on the specific requirements of the application.

## Asking for tag types
Here is the definition of tag:
Tags are labels or other physical objects used to identify the Physical Entity to which it is attached.Tags are used to identify Physical Entities, to which the Tags are usually physically attached. The primary purpose of Tags is to facilitate and increase the accuracy of the identification process. This process can be optical, as in the case of barcodes and QR codes, or it can be RF-based, as in the case of microwave car-plate recognition systems and RFID.

Two examples of tag are: "RFID tags" and "NFC Tags".
