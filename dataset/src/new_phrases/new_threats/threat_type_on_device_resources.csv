PLTT;Power Supply Disruption;Power supply disruption can be a threat to IoT device resources. IoT devices rely on a stable power supply to function properly, and a disruption in the power supply can cause a variety of issues, including data loss, system crashes, and damage to hardware components. In the context of on-device resources, power supply disruption can cause the device to lose power and shut down, potentially leading to data loss or corruption. Additionally, power supply disruption can cause the device to reboot repeatedly, leading to increased wear and tear on hardware components and potentially shortening the lifespan of the device. To mitigate the risk of power supply disruption, it is important to ensure that IoT devices are properly installed and configured with backup power sources, such as batteries or uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). It is also important to regularly monitor the power supply and implement measures to reduce power consumption, such as optimizing software and hardware settings. In the event of a power supply disruption, it is important to have a plan in place to quickly restore power and minimize the impact on device resources.;Kimani, K., Oduol, V. and Langat, K., 2019. Cyber security challenges for IoT-based smart grid networks. International journal of critical infrastructure protection, 25, pp.36-49.
NTT;Extreme temperatures;Extreme temperatures can be a threat to IoT device resources because they can cause the devices to malfunction or even fail completely. High temperatures can cause electronic components to overheat and degrade, leading to reduced device performance or permanent damage. Conversely, low temperatures can cause batteries to drain more quickly or even freeze, which can also lead to device failure. In addition to direct effects on device components, extreme temperatures can also impact the surrounding environment, causing physical damage to the devices or making them more vulnerable to other types of threats such as moisture or dust. To mitigate the impact of extreme temperatures on IoT devices, it is important to consider factors such as device location, installation, and backup power sources, as well as implementing measures to regulate temperature and reduce power consumption.;Schubert, E.F. and Kim, J.K., 2005. Solid-state light sources getting smart. Science, 308(5726), pp.1274-1278.
NTT;Floods;Sensors located in areas prone to flooding or water damage may be damaged or destroyed, leading to data loss.;
NTT;Lightning strikes;Lightning strikes can be a significant threat to IoT device resources, as they can cause physical damage to the devices and disrupt their operation. A direct lightning strike can destroy an IoT device or cause it to malfunction, leading to data loss or system downtime. Even if a device is not directly struck by lightning, the electromagnetic fields generated by nearby lightning strikes can induce voltage spikes or electromagnetic interference, leading to data corruption or system instability. To mitigate the impact of lightning strikes on IoT devices, it is important to consider factors such as device location, grounding, and surge protection. Devices should be installed in areas that are less likely to be struck by lightning, and should be properly grounded to reduce the risk of damage from electrical surges. Additionally, surge protectors and other protective measures can be used to limit the impact of voltage spikes and electromagnetic interference on IoT devices.;Schubert, E.F. and Kim, J.K., 2005. Solid-state light sources getting smart. Science, 308(5726), pp.1274-1278.
HTT;Firmware attacks;Firmware attacks are a type of cyber attack that targets the firmware of an IoT device. Firmware is the software that is embedded in the hardware of a device, and it controls the device's functions. Firmware attacks can compromise the security of an IoT device by exploiting vulnerabilities in the firmware. In the context of IoT on-device resources, firmware attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to the device's resources, modify its behavior, or extract sensitive information. For example, an attacker could use a firmware attack to disable security features on an IoT device, allowing them to access its data or use it as a platform for launching further attacks. To mitigate the risk of firmware attacks, it is important to ensure that IoT devices are running the latest firmware version and to implement security measures such as encryption, access control, and identity authentication. Additionally, regular firmware updates and vulnerability assessments can help to identify and address potential security issues before they can be exploited.;Bettayeb, M., Nasir, Q. and Talib, M.A., 2019, March. Firmware update attacks and security for IoT devices: Survey. In Proceedings of the ArabWIC 6th Annual International Conference Research Track (pp. 1-6).
HTT;Side-channel attacks;Side-channel attacks are a type of security threat that target the physical characteristics of a device, such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing information, to extract sensitive information. In the context of IoT devices, side-channel attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to on-device resources, such as encryption keys, passwords, or other sensitive data. For example, an attacker could analyze the power consumption of an IoT device during a cryptographic operation to infer the value of a secret key. Similarly, an attacker could use electromagnetic emissions to eavesdrop on wireless communications between IoT devices and extract sensitive data. To mitigate side-channel attacks, IoT devices should be designed with security in mind. This includes implementing countermeasures such as power analysis-resistant cryptography, electromagnetic shielding, and randomization of timing information. Additionally, IoT devices should be regularly updated with the latest security patches and firmware updates to address any known vulnerabilities.;Spreitzer, R., Moonsamy, V., Korak, T. and Mangard, S., 2017. Systematic classification of side-channel attacks: A case study for mobile devices. IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 20(1), pp.465-488.
HTT;Supply chain attacks;Supply chain attacks are a type of cyber attack that targets the supply chain of a product or service. In the context of IoT devices, a supply chain attack can occur when a malicious actor infiltrates the supply chain of a device and introduces malicious code or hardware into the device during the manufacturing process. This can result in compromised security of the device and the on-device resources, including data and processing power. For example, a supply chain attack on an IoT sensor used in supply chain management could compromise the integrity of the data collected by the sensor, leading to incorrect decisions being made based on the compromised data. To mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks, it is important to ensure that all components of an IoT device are sourced from trusted suppliers and to implement robust security measures, such as encryption and access control, to protect against unauthorized access to on-device resources.;Yang, K., Forte, D. and Tehranipoor, M.M., 2015, November. Protecting endpoint devices in IoT supply chain. In 2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) (pp. 351-356). IEEE.
NLTT;Man In the Middle Attack;Attackers can intercept data being transmitted between IoT sensors and other devices, allowing them to eavesdrop on or modify the data.;
NLTT;Network Erros;Attackers can use radio frequency interference to disrupt wireless communication between IoT sensors and other devices.;
NLTT;Rogue access points;Rogue access points are unauthorized wireless access points that are installed on a network without the knowledge or approval of the network administrator. These access points can be used to intercept and manipulate data traffic, and can pose a significant threat to the security of IoT devices that rely on wireless connectivity. When a rogue access point is installed on a network, it can potentially compromise the security of any IoT devices that are connected to that network. This is because rogue access points can intercept and manipulate data traffic, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials, financial information, and personal information. In addition to compromising the security of IoT devices, rogue access points can also consume on-device resources, such as battery life and processing power. This can lead to reduced performance and shorter battery life for IoT devices, which can negatively impact their functionality and usability. To mitigate the threat of rogue access points, IoT devices should be designed with robust security features that can detect and prevent unauthorized access to the device and its data. Additionally, network administrators should implement strict access controls and monitoring protocols to detect and remove rogue access points from the network.;Cox, J.H., Clark, R. and Owen, H., 2017. Leveraging SDN and WebRTC for rogue access point security. IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 14(3), pp.756-770.
ALTT;Injection Attacks;Injection attacks are a type of cyber attack where an attacker injects malicious code or commands into a program or system with the intent of causing it to behave in unintended ways. In the context of IoT devices, injection attacks can pose a significant threat to on-device resources by consuming processing power, memory, and battery life.  For example, an attacker may inject code into an IoT device that causes it to continuously execute a particular task, such as sending data to a remote server. This can consume significant processing power and battery life, which can lead to reduced performance and shorter battery life for the device. In some cases, injection attacks can also cause IoT devices to crash or become unresponsive, which can further impact their functionality and usability. To mitigate the threat of injection attacks, IoT devices should be designed with robust security features that can detect and prevent unauthorized access to the device and its data. Additionally, developers should follow secure coding practices and implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks from occurring in the first place. Network administrators should also implement strict access controls and monitoring protocols to detect and respond to injection attacks in real-time.;Gaber, T., El-Ghamry, A. and Hassanien, A.E., 2022. Injection attack detection using machine learning for smart IoT applications. Physical Communication, 52, p.101685.
PLTT;Power Outages;Power outages can be a significant threat to IoT on-device resources because many IoT devices rely on a constant power supply to function correctly. When a power outage occurs, IoT devices may lose power, which can lead to data loss, corruption, and even hardware damage. This can be particularly problematic for IoT devices that are responsible for critical functions, such as medical devices or industrial control systems. In addition to the risk of data loss and hardware damage, power outages can also leave IoT devices vulnerable to cyber attacks. During a power outage, IoT devices may be left without the necessary security measures in place, making them more susceptible to hacking or other malicious activity. To mitigate the risks of power outages, IoT devices should be designed with backup power sources, such as batteries or generators, and should be equipped with appropriate security measures to protect against cyber threats. Additionally, organizations should have contingency plans in place to deal with power outages and other potential disruptions to IoT device functionality.;Imteaj, A., Thakker, U., Wang, S., Li, J. and Amini, M.H., 2021. A survey on federated learning for resource-constrained IoT devices. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 9(1), pp.1-24.
HTT;Hardware Failure;Hardware failure is a significant threat to IoT on-device resources because it can result in the loss or corruption of data and damage to the hardware itself. Hardware failure can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as overheating, power surges, and physical damage. When hardware fails, it can cause the IoT device to stop functioning properly, which can impact the functionality of the entire IoT system. To mitigate the risks of hardware failure, IoT devices should be designed with high-quality components and undergo rigorous testing to ensure their reliability. Additionally, backup power sources and redundancy measures can help ensure that IoT devices continue to function even in the event of hardware failure.;Sánchez, P.M.S., Valero, J.M.J., Celdrán, A.H., Bovet, G., Pérez, M.G. and Pérez, G.M., 2021. A survey on device behavior fingerprinting: Data sources, techniques, application scenarios, and datasets. IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 23(2), pp.1048-1077.
NTT;Wildlife;Wildlife can pose a threat to IoT on-device resources, especially in outdoor environments. For example, animals such as birds, rodents, and insects can damage IoT devices by chewing through cables, nesting inside the devices, or causing physical damage to the hardware. This can result in the loss of data, disruption of communication between devices, and even complete failure of the IoT system. To mitigate the risks of wildlife damage to IoT devices, organizations can take several steps. For example, they can use protective covers or enclosures to prevent animals from accessing the devices. Additionally, regular maintenance and inspections can help identify and address any issues before they cause significant damage. Finally, organizations can consider using more robust and durable IoT devices that are specifically designed to withstand harsh outdoor environments.;Hawkins, P., 2004. Bio-logging and animal welfare: practical refinements.
HTT;Malfunctions / Faulty hardware;hardware malfunction can lead to device failure or data loss.;
HTT;Natural Wear;IoT sensors can become obsolete over time, leading to reduced functionality or compatibility issues with other devices.;
ALTT;Memory leaks;Memory leaks occur when a program or application does not release memory that is no longer needed, causing the device to run out of memory over time. This can be a significant threat to IoT on-device resources because it can cause the device to slow down or crash, leading to data loss or other issues. In an IoT context, memory leaks can be particularly problematic because many IoT devices have limited memory resources to begin with. If a memory leak goes undetected, it can lead to the device becoming unresponsive or even completely inoperable. To mitigate this risk, IoT developers should implement memory management techniques to ensure that memory is properly allocated and released as needed. Additionally, regular testing and monitoring can help identify and address any memory leaks before they cause significant issues.;Carter, J., Mancoridis, S. and Galinkin, E., 2022, April. Fast, lightweight IoT anomaly detection using feature pruning and PCA. In Proceedings of the 37th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (pp. 133-138).
ALTT;Buffer overflow attacks;Buffer overflow attacks can occur when an application receives more data than it is designed to handle, which can lead to crashes and compromised functionality of IoT devices.;Tushir, B., Dalal, Y., Dezfouli, B. and Liu, Y., 2020. A quantitative study of ddos and e-ddos attacks on wifi smart home devices. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8(8), pp.6282-6292.
