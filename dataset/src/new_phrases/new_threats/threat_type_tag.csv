PLTT;Tag Removal or Replacement;Tag removal is a type of physical attack that can be used to compromise the security of IoT tags. This involves physically removing the tag from the object it is attached to, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the object or to the data stored on the tag. This type of attack is particularly concerning in situations where the tag is being used to secure valuable or sensitive items, such as in supply chain management or asset tracking. To mitigate this risk, IoT tags can be designed with tamper-evident features that make it difficult or impossible to remove the tag without damaging it or triggering an alarm. Additionally, tags can be paired with sensors that can detect when they have been removed from an object and alert security personnel to the potential threat.;AL MOGBIL, R., AL ASQAH, M. and EL KHEDIRI, S., 2020, September. Iot: Security challenges and issues of smart homes/cities. In 2020 International Conference on Computing and Information Technology (ICCIT-1441) (pp. 1-6). IEEE.
PLTT;Tempering;Attackers modify the IoT tag to change its behavior or steal data.;
PLTT;Jamming;Attackers use radio frequency interference to disrupt communication between the tag and reader.;
PLTT;Signal Blocking;Signal blocking is a type of threat to IoT tags that occurs when the communication signals between the tag and the network are intentionally blocked or jammed. This can be done by an attacker using a jamming device or by simply physically obstructing the signal with materials such as metal or concrete. When the signal is blocked, the tag is unable to communicate with the network, which can result in a loss of data or even a complete failure of the IoT system. This type of threat can be mitigated by implementing security measures such as using multiple communication channels and ensuring that the tags have backup power sources.;Rusli, M.E., Ali, M., Jamil, N. and Din, M.M., 2016, July. An improved indoor positioning algorithm based on rssi-trilateration technique for internet of things (iot). In 2016 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE) (pp. 72-77). IEEE.
PLTT;Power Outages;Power outages can be a threat to IoT tags because they rely on a steady source of power to function properly. If the power goes out, the tags may not be able to communicate with the network or perform their intended functions. This can cause a loss of data or even a complete failure of the IoT system. To mitigate this threat, it is important to ensure that the tags have backup power sources, such as batteries or generators, that can keep them running during power outages. Additionally, implementing power management strategies, such as reducing power consumption during periods of low activity, can help to prolong the life of the backup power sources and ensure that the tags remain operational for as long as possible.;Soltan, S., Mittal, P. and Poor, H.V., 2018. BlackIoT: IoT botnet of high wattage devices can disrupt the power grid. In 27th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 18) (pp. 15-32).
NTT;Lightning Strikes;Lightning strikes can be a threat to IoT tags, especially those that are deployed in outdoor environments. A lightning strike can generate a high voltage surge that can damage or destroy electronic devices, including IoT tags. To mitigate this risk, it is important to use surge protectors and grounding systems to divert the electrical energy away from the IoT tags. Additionally, it may be necessary to use ruggedized tags that are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions.;Mialdea-Flor, I., Segura-Garcia, J., Felici-Castell, S., Garcia-Pineda, M., Alcaraz-Calero, J.M. and Navarro-Camba, E., 2019. Development of a low-cost IoT system for lightning strike detection and location. Electronics, 8(12), p.1512.
NTT;Landslides;landslides can be a threat to IoT tags, particularly those that are deployed in areas where landslides are likely to occur. Landslides can cause physical damage to IoT tags, as well as disrupt communication channels and power sources. To mitigate this risk, it is important to use ruggedized tags that are designed to withstand physical damage and to deploy them in areas that are less likely to be affected by landslides. It may also be necessary to use backup power sources, such as batteries or solar panels, to ensure that the tags continue to operate even in the event of a power outage caused by a landslide.;Oguz, E.A., Robinson, K., Depina, I. and Thakur, V., 2019, December. IoT-based strategies for risk management of rainfall-induced landslides: a review. In Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Geotechnical Safety and Risk (ISGSR 2019), Taipei, Taiwan (pp. 11-13).
NTT;Tornadoes;Tornadoes can be a threat to IoT tags in several ways. First, tornadoes can physically damage the IoT tags and the infrastructure they are attached to, such as buildings and power lines. This can result in the loss of data and communication capabilities. Second, tornadoes can cause power outages, which can affect the operation of IoT tags that rely on electricity. Third, tornadoes can disrupt communication networks, which can prevent IoT tags from transmitting data to their intended destinations. To mitigate these risks, it is important to use durable IoT tags and backup power sources that can withstand tornadoes and other natural disasters. Additionally, it is important to have contingency plans in place to ensure that communication and data transfer can continue in the event of a tornado or other disaster.;Liu, Y., Wang, K., Qian, K., Du, M. and Guo, S., 2019. Tornado: Enabling blockchain in heterogeneous Internet of Things through a space-structured approach. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7(2), pp.1273-1286.
NTT;Tsunamis;Tsunamis can be a threat to IoT tags in several ways. First, tsunamis can physically damage the infrastructure that IoT tags are attached to, such as buildings, bridges, and power lines. This can result in the loss of data and communication capabilities. Second, tsunamis can cause power outages, which can affect the operation of IoT tags that rely on electricity. Third, tsunamis can disrupt communication networks, which can prevent IoT tags from transmitting data to their intended destinations. To mitigate these risks, it is important to use durable IoT tags and backup power sources that can withstand tsunamis and other natural disasters. Additionally, it is important to have contingency plans in place to ensure that communication and data transfer can continue in the event of a tsunami or other disaster.;Nimbargi, S.R., Hadawale, S. and Ghodke, G., 2017, December. Tsunami alert & detection system using IoT: A survey. In 2017 International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Data Science (BID) (pp. 182-184). IEEE.
HTT;Counterfeit Tags;Counterfeit tags are a type of threat to IoT tags that involves the creation and distribution of fake or imitation tags that mimic the appearance and functionality of legitimate IoT tags. These counterfeit tags can be used to infiltrate IoT systems and networks, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to carry out other malicious activities. Counterfeit tags can also be used to undermine the integrity of supply chains by allowing counterfeit goods to be passed off as legitimate products. To mitigate the risk of counterfeit tags, it is important to use trusted vendors for IoT tags and to implement robust supply chain management practices. Additionally, it can be helpful to use authentication mechanisms to verify the authenticity of IoT tags and to monitor for any signs of tampering or counterfeiting.;Popović, T., Krčo, S., Maraš, V., Hakola, L., Radonjić, S., Van Kranenburg, R. and Šandi, S., 2021. A novel solution for counterfeit prevention in the wine industry based on IoT, smart tags, and crowd-sourced information. Internet of Things, 14, p.100375.
HTT;Malfunctions / Faulty Hardware;Malfunctioning IoT tags can cause errors in the system or disrupt communication.;
NLTT;Man in The Middle Attack;Attackers intercept and modify communication between the tag and reader.;
NLTT;Eavesdropping and Traffic Analysis;Attackers listen in on communication between the tag and reader to steal data.;
NLTT;DoS/DDoS in Network Layer;Attackers flood the system with traffic to disrupt communication.;
ALTT;Data Breaches;Data breaches are a type of threat to IoT tags that involves the unauthorized access, theft, or disclosure of sensitive data that is stored or transmitted by IoT tags. This can include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive information. Data breaches can occur due to a variety of factors, including vulnerabilities in IoT tag firmware or software, weak passwords, or social engineering attacks. To mitigate the risk of data breaches, it is important to implement robust security measures for IoT tags, such as using encryption to protect data in transit and at rest, implementing access controls to limit access to sensitive data, and regularly updating firmware and software to address known vulnerabilities. Additionally, it can be helpful to monitor IoT tags for any signs of suspicious activity, such as unusual data transfers or unauthorized access attempts.;Moganedi, S., 2018, June. Undetectable data breach in iot: Healthcare data at risk. In 17th European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (Vol. 2, p. 296).
ALTT;Social Engineering;Attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.;
ALTT;Phishing Attacks;Phishing attacks are a type of social engineering attack that aims to trick people into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. In the context of IoT tags, phishing attacks can be used to steal login credentials for IoT tag management systems or to trick users into downloading malware onto their devices. Once attackers have access to these systems or devices, they can modify or disable IoT tags, steal data, or launch further attacks. Phishing attacks can be particularly effective against IoT tags because they often rely on simple login credentials and may not have strong security controls in place. To mitigate this threat, it is important to educate users about the risks of phishing and to implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to IoT tag management systems. Additionally, IoT tags should be designed with security in mind, with features such as secure boot, firmware updates, and encryption to protect against attacks.;Bhardwaj, A., Al-Turjman, F., Sapra, V., Kumar, M. and Stephan, T., 2021. Privacy-aware detection framework to mitigate new-age phishing attacks. Computers & Electrical Engineering, 96, p.107546.
PLTT;Power Drain;Power drain is a security threat to IoT tags, which refers to the depletion of the battery power of an IoT tag due to malicious activities or inefficient power management. When an IoT tag's battery is drained, it can no longer function as intended, which can result in a loss of data or a failure to track assets. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in IoT tags to drain their batteries by sending excessive requests, injecting malicious code, or using denial-of-service attacks. To mitigate this threat, IoT tags should be designed to use power efficiently, and organizations should implement measures such as access controls and firmware updates to protect against attacks. Additionally, organizations can use backup power sources or energy harvesting techniques to ensure that IoT tags continue to function even if their batteries are drained.;Sodhro, A.H., Pirbhulal, S., Luo, Z. and De Albuquerque, V.H.C., 2019. Towards an optimal resource management for IoT based Green and sustainable smart cities. Journal of Cleaner Production, 220, pp.1167-1179.
ALTT;Data Tampering;Data tampering is another security threat to IoT tags, which refers to the unauthorized modification of data stored on or transmitted by an IoT tag. Attackers can tamper with data to manipulate the behavior of IoT devices or to gain access to sensitive information. For example, an attacker could modify the data transmitted by an IoT tag to make it appear as though a shipment was delivered when it was not, or to change the temperature readings of a refrigerated container to cause spoilage of the contents. To mitigate this threat, organizations should implement measures such as encryption, digital signatures, and access controls to protect the integrity of data transmitted by IoT tags. Additionally, organizations should monitor IoT devices for unusual activity and implement measures such as firmware and software updates to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.;Shrivastava, R.K., Mishra, S., Archana, V.E. and Hota, C., 2019, December. Preventing data tampering in IoT networks. In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS) (pp. 1-6). IEEE.
ALTT;Application Vulnerabilities;Application vulnerabilities are another security threat to IoT tags, which refers to weaknesses or flaws in the software or firmware that runs on an IoT tag. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the IoT tag or to the network to which it is connected. For example, an attacker could exploit a vulnerability in an IoT tag's firmware to gain access to sensitive data stored on the device or to take control of the device and use it to launch attacks on other devices or systems. To mitigate this threat, IoT tags should be designed with security in mind, and organizations should implement measures such as code reviews, penetration testing, and software updates to identify and address vulnerabilities. Additionally, organizations should implement access controls and network segmentation to limit the impact of a successful attack on an IoT tag.;Andrea, I., Chrysostomou, C. and Hadjichristofi, G., 2015, July. Internet of Things: Security vulnerabilities and challenges. In 2015 IEEE symposium on computers and communication (ISCC) (pp. 180-187). IEEE.
ALTT;Insider Threats;Insider threats refer to security risks posed by individuals who have authorized access to an organization's network or systems, such as employees, contractors, or partners. These individuals may intentionally or unintentionally misuse their access to sensitive data or systems, potentially compromising the security of IoT tags and other devices connected to the network. For example, an employee with access to an IoT tag's data may intentionally leak sensitive information to unauthorized parties, or they may inadvertently introduce malware onto the network by using an infected device to access the network. To mitigate insider threats, organizations should implement strong access controls, monitor network activity for suspicious behavior, and provide security awareness training to employees and other authorized users. Additionally, organizations should implement policies and procedures for reporting and responding to security incidents, including those involving insider threats.;Kim, A., Oh, J., Ryu, J. and Lee, K., 2020. A review of insider threat detection approaches with IoT perspective. IEEE Access, 8, pp.78847-78867.
ALTT;Cross-Site Scripting (XSS);Attackers can inject malicious code into web pages or applications used by the IoT tag, allowing them to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to systems.;Singh, M., Singh, P. and Kumar, P., 2020, March. An analytical study on cross-site scripting. In 2020 International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Applications (ICCSEA) (pp. 1-6). IEEE.
ALTT;SQL Injection;Attackers can inject malicious code into the IoT tag's database, allowing them to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to systems.;Gowtham, M. and Pramod, H.B., 2021. Semantic query-featured ensemble learning model for SQL-injection attack detection in IoT-ecosystems. IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 71(2), pp.1057-1074.
HTT;Inadequate Encryption;Inadequate encryption can be a significant threat to IoT tags as it can leave the data transmitted by the tags vulnerable to interception and decryption by unauthorized parties. If the encryption used is weak or outdated, it can be easily bypassed, allowing attackers to access sensitive information like location data, inventory levels, and other critical data. This can lead to a breach of security, loss of data, and potential financial loss. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that IoT tags use strong encryption methods and that they are regularly updated to prevent any potential security breaches.;Shrestha, R. and Kim, S., 2019. Integration of IoT with blockchain and homomorphic encryption: Challenging issues and opportunities. In Advances in computers (Vol. 115, pp. 293-331). Elsevier.
PLTT;Physical Damage;attackers can physically destroy the tag, rendering it useless and preventing it from communicating with the reader.;
ALTT;Brute-Force Attacks;attackers can use brute-force techniques to guess passwords or other authentication credentials, allowing them to gain unauthorized access or control of the system.;Stiawan, D., Idris, M., Malik, R.F., Nurmaini, S., Alsharif, N. and Budiarto, R., 2019. Investigating brute force attack patterns in IoT network. Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2019.
