PLTT;Physical Damage;This threat involves physical damage or tampering of the IoT sensors, which can lead to data loss or device failure.;
PLTT;Electromagnetic Interference (EMI);Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is a type of threat to IoT applications that occurs when the electromagnetic fields generated by one device interfere with the operation of another device. EMI can be caused by a variety of sources, including other electronic devices, power lines, and radio waves. When two electronic devices are in close proximity to each other, the electromagnetic fields they generate can interact with each other. This can cause interference that can disrupt the operation of one or both devices. For example, if an IoT device that uses wireless communication is located near a microwave oven, the electromagnetic field generated by the microwave oven can interfere with the wireless signal, causing the IoT device to malfunction or lose connectivity. EMI can also be caused by external sources, such as power lines or radio waves. Power lines can generate strong electromagnetic fields, which can interfere with nearby electronic devices. Radio waves can also cause EMI, particularly if they are in the same frequency range as the device's operating frequency. To mitigate the risk of EMI in IoT applications, it is important to carefully design devices and systems to minimize electromagnetic interference. This can include using shielding to protect devices from external sources of EMI, as well as designing devices to minimize their own electromagnetic emissions. It is also important to test devices and systems in real-world environments to identify and address any EMI issues that may arise.EMI can affect the performance of IoT sensors and cause data loss or device failure.;Mathur, P. and Raman, S., 2020. Electromagnetic interference (EMI): Measurement and reduction techniques. Journal of Electronic Materials, 49, pp.2975-2998.
PLTT;Radio Frequency (RF) Interference;Radio frequency (RF) interference is a type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can be a significant threat to IoT applications. RF interference occurs when unwanted radio frequency signals disrupt the normal operation of an electronic device or system. These signals may come from a variety of sources, including nearby electronic devices, power lines, and wireless transmissions. In IoT applications, RF interference can cause a range of problems, including lost connections, degraded performance, and even complete system failure. This is particularly problematic in applications where reliable and continuous connectivity is critical, such as in industrial automation, healthcare monitoring, and transportation systems. To mitigate the risk of RF interference, IoT devices and systems must be designed with appropriate shielding and filtering to reduce the impact of external RF signals. This may involve the use of specialized materials and components, as well as careful placement and grounding of devices. Additionally, it is important to thoroughly test IoT devices and systems in real-world environments to identify and address any potential sources of RF interference.;Gummadi, R., Wetherall, D., Greenstein, B. and Seshan, S., 2007. Understanding and mitigating the impact of RF interference on 802.11 networks. ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 37(4), pp.385-396.
NTT;Extreme Temperatures;Extreme temperatures can be a threat to IoT applications as they can cause damage to electronic components and affect the performance and reliability of the devices. Extreme temperatures can be defined as temperatures that are either too high or too low for the normal operation of the device.  High temperatures can cause electronic components to overheat, which can lead to malfunctions or even permanent damage to the device. This can be particularly problematic in IoT applications where devices may be located in environments with high temperatures, such as industrial settings or outdoor environments. In addition, high temperatures can also affect the battery life of the device, causing it to drain more quickly than expected. Low temperatures can also be a threat to IoT applications, as they can cause the device to malfunction or even stop working altogether. Low temperatures can cause the battery to drain more quickly, and can also affect the performance of the device's sensors and other components. In addition, the expansion and contraction of materials due to temperature changes can cause mechanical stress on the device, which can lead to damage over time. To mitigate the threat of extreme temperatures, IoT devices can be designed with temperature sensors to monitor the temperature of the device and its surroundings. In addition, the device can be designed with materials that can withstand extreme temperatures or with cooling systems to prevent overheating. It is also important to test IoT devices in a range of temperatures to ensure that they can operate effectively in different environments.;Maraveas, C. and Bartzanas, T., 2021. Application of Internet of Things (IoT) for optimized greenhouse environments. AgriEngineering, 3(4), pp.954-970.
NTT;Lightning Strikes;Lightning strikes can pose a significant threat to IoT applications. Lightning is a natural phenomenon that occurs when there is a buildup of electrical charge in the atmosphere. When this charge is discharged, it can produce a high-voltage electrical current that can travel through the air and strike objects on the ground, including IoT devices. When a lightning strike hits an IoT device, it can cause significant damage to the device's electronic components. The high voltage can cause electrical arcing, which can damage or destroy sensitive electronic components. In addition, the electrical current can generate heat, which can also damage the device. To protect IoT devices from lightning strikes, it is important to use surge protection devices and grounding systems. Surge protection devices can help to divert the electrical current away from the device, while grounding systems can help to dissipate the electrical charge and reduce the risk of damage. In addition to physical protection measures, it is also important to ensure that IoT devices are designed with robust electronic components that can withstand the high voltages and electrical currents associated with lightning strikes. This can include the use of high-quality circuit boards, protective coatings, and other materials that can help to reduce the risk of damage. Regular testing and maintenance of IoT devices can also help to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by lightning strikes or other threats.;Mialdea-Flor, I., Segura-Garcia, J., Felici-Castell, S., Garcia-Pineda, M., Alcaraz-Calero, J.M. and Navarro-Camba, E., 2019. Development of a low-cost IoT system for lightning strike detection and location. Electronics, 8(12), p.1512.
HTT;Natural Wear;IoT sensors can degrade over time due to aging and wear and tear, which can lead to data loss or device failure.;
HTT;Design Flaws;Design flaws refer to weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the design of a system or device that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security or functionality of the system. In the context of IoT applications, design flaws can pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of devices, as well as the data they collect and transmit. Design flaws can occur at various stages of the development process, from the initial design phase to the implementation and deployment of the system. For example, a design flaw in the hardware or software of a device could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device or its data, or to manipulate the device in unintended ways. To mitigate the threat of design flaws in IoT applications, it is important to conduct thorough security assessments and testing throughout the development process. This includes identifying potential vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate security measures to address them. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and updates to the system can help to detect and address any new vulnerabilities that may arise over time.;Janes, B., Crawford, H. and OConnor, T.J., 2020, May. Never ending story: authentication and access control design flaws in shared IoT devices. In 2020 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW) (pp. 104-109). IEEE.
NLTT;DoS/DDoS in Network Layer;DoS attacks can overload IoT sensors and cause data loss or device failure.;
NLTT;Routing Information Attacks;Routing attacks can disrupt the communication between IoT sensors and cause data loss or device failure.;
ALTT;Injection Attacks;Injection attacks are a common type of cyber attack that can pose a serious threat to IoT applications. In an injection attack, an attacker sends malicious code or commands to an application with the goal of exploiting vulnerabilities and gaining unauthorized access to the system.  There are several types of injection attacks, including SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. In SQL injection, an attacker inserts malicious code into an SQL query, which can allow them to view, modify, or delete data from a database. In command injection, an attacker inserts malicious code into a command that is executed by the system, which can allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the system. In XSS attacks, an attacker injects malicious code into a web page, which can allow them to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions. Injection attacks can be particularly dangerous for IoT applications, as they can allow an attacker to take control of a device or sensor and potentially cause physical harm. For example, an attacker could inject malicious code into a temperature sensor, causing it to report false readings and potentially leading to damage or safety hazards. To prevent injection attacks, it is important to implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques, as well as to use secure coding practices such as parameterized queries and prepared statements. Additionally, regular security testing and vulnerability assessments can help to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.;Gangolli, A., Mahmoud, Q.H. and Azim, A., 2022. A systematic review of fault injection attacks on IOT systems. Electronics, 11(13), p.2023.
ALTT;Malicious Scripts;Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can inject malicious code into the web interface of IoT sensors and compromise the security of the system. ;
PLTT;Power Supply Manipulation;Power Supply Manipulation is a type of threat to IoT sensors that involves an attacker manipulating the power supply of a sensor in order to compromise its security or disrupt its functionality. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by injecting noise into the power supply, altering the voltage or current levels, or simply cutting off the power altogether. The goal of Power Supply Manipulation is to cause the sensor to behave in unexpected ways, or to extract sensitive information from it. For example, an attacker might manipulate the power supply of a temperature sensor in order to cause it to report false readings, which could then be used to trigger a fire alarm or other safety system. Alternatively, an attacker might use Power Supply Manipulation to extract cryptographic keys or other sensitive data from a sensor, which could then be used to compromise other parts of a system. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of Power Supply Manipulation in IoT sensors. These include using secure power supplies that are resistant to manipulation, implementing strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data, and monitoring power consumption levels and other indicators to detect signs of tampering. Additionally, it is important to ensure that IoT sensors are physically secure and protected against unauthorized access, as this can help to prevent attackers from gaining access to the power supply in the first place.;Wang, K., Xiao, S., Ji, X., Yan, C., Li, C. and Xu, W., 2023, May. Volttack: Control IoT Devices by Manipulating Power Supply Voltage. In 2023 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP) (pp. 1771-1788). IEEE Computer Society.
HTT;Sensor Spoofing;Sensor spoofing is another type of threat to IoT sensors that involves an attacker creating a fake sensor or manipulating the data from a legitimate sensor in order to deceive the system. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by using a device that mimics the behavior of a real sensor, or by intercepting and altering the data from a legitimate sensor. The goal of sensor spoofing is to manipulate the system into taking actions that benefit the attacker, such as granting access to a restricted area or triggering a security alarm. For example, an attacker might create a fake temperature sensor that reports a high temperature in order to trigger a fire alarm and cause a building to be evacuated. Alternatively, an attacker might intercept the data from a legitimate sensor and alter it in order to make it appear as though a security breach has occurred, which could then be used to gain unauthorized access to a system. There are a number of different techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk of sensor spoofing in IoT systems. These include implementing strong authentication and encryption mechanisms to protect the data transmitted by sensors, using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of sensor data, and implementing anomaly detection algorithms to detect abnormal sensor behavior. Additionally, it is important to ensure that sensors are physically secure and protected against tampering, as this can help to prevent attackers from creating fake sensors or intercepting data from legitimate ones.;Hasan, M. and Mohan, S., 2019, November. Protecting actuators in safety-critical IoT systems from control spoofing attacks. In Proceedings of the 2nd International ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy for the Internet-of-Things (pp. 8-14).
HTT;Memory Corruption;Memory corruption is a type of threat that can affect IoT sensors. In this context, memory corruption refers to the manipulation of the memory of an IoT sensor in a way that it can be exploited by attackers. An attacker can exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities in IoT sensors to compromise the sensor's security, steal sensitive data, or take control of the device. Memory corruption can occur in many ways, but one common method is through buffer overflow attacks. In a buffer overflow attack, an attacker sends more data to a buffer than it can handle, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can lead to the execution of malicious code or the modification of critical data. Another type of memory corruption attack is the use of format string vulnerabilities. In this type of attack, an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in the way a program handles format strings to read or write to arbitrary memory locations. To mitigate the risk of memory corruption attacks on IoT sensors, it is important to apply security best practices when developing and deploying IoT devices. This includes using secure coding practices, such as input validation and error handling, and implementing proper memory management techniques. Additionally, regular security updates and patches should be applied to IoT devices to address any known vulnerabilities.;English, K.V., Obaidat, I. and Sridhar, M., 2019, June. Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in connman for iot devices. In 2019 49th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) (pp. 247-255). IEEE.
HTT;Side-Channel Attacks;Side-channel attacks are a type of security threat that can affect IoT sensors. These attacks involve analyzing the physical characteristics of a device, such as its power consumption or electromagnetic emissions, to extract sensitive information. For example, an attacker might use a side-channel attack to determine the secret key used for encryption on an IoT sensor. This can be a serious threat to the security of the sensor and the overall system it is a part of. To mitigate this threat, IoT designers can implement countermeasures such as power analysis-resistant designs, randomizing the power consumption of the device, or using differential power analysis-resistant encryption algorithms.;Devi, M. and Majumder, A., 2021. Side-channel attack in Internet of Things: A survey. In Applications of Internet of Things: Proceedings of ICCCIOT 2020 (pp. 213-222). Springer Singapore.
NTT;Landslides;Landslides can pose a threat to IoT sensors that are deployed in areas prone to landslides. In such areas, landslides can cause physical damage to sensors, disrupt power and communication infrastructure, and even cause sensors to become dislodged or completely destroyed. This can result in a loss of data and a decrease in the accuracy and effectiveness of the sensor network. To mitigate this threat, IoT designers can use ruggedized sensors that are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, as well as redundant power and communication systems that can continue to operate even if one system is disrupted. Additionally, sensors can be placed in locations that are less likely to be affected by landslides, or can be equipped with sensors that can detect and alert operators to potential landslide events.;Oguz, E.A., Robinson, K., Depina, I. and Thakur, V., 2019, December. IoT-based strategies for risk management of rainfall-induced landslides: a review. In Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Geotechnical Safety and Risk (ISGSR 2019), Taipei, Taiwan (pp. 11-13).
NTT;Tornadoes;Tornadoes are a natural disaster that can pose a threat to IoT sensors. Tornadoes are powerful storms that can cause widespread damage and destruction, including damage to buildings and infrastructure. IoT sensors that are located in areas that are prone to tornadoes may be at risk of damage or destruction. This can lead to a loss of data, as well as a loss of functionality for the sensor. In addition, the high winds associated with tornadoes can cause physical damage to the sensors, which can lead to malfunctions or complete failure. To mitigate this risk, it is important to ensure that IoT sensors are located in secure and protected areas, and that they are built to withstand the potential damage caused by tornadoes.;Liu, Y., Wang, K., Qian, K., Du, M. and Guo, S., 2019. Tornado: Enabling blockchain in heterogeneous Internet of Things through a space-structured approach. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7(2), pp.1273-1286.
HTT;Firmware Vulnerabilities;Firmware vulnerabilities are a common threat to IoT sensors. Firmware is the software that is embedded in the hardware of the sensor and controls its operation. If the firmware is not secure, it can be vulnerable to attacks that can compromise the sensor's functionality and the data it collects. Hackers can exploit firmware vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the sensor, modify its behavior, or steal sensitive data. To address this threat, it is important to ensure that firmware is developed using secure coding practices and is regularly updated to patch any known vulnerabilities. Additionally, sensors should be designed with secure boot and firmware update mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications.;Xie, W., Jiang, Y., Tang, Y., Ding, N. and Gao, Y., 2017, December. Vulnerability detection in iot firmware: A survey. In 2017 IEEE 23rd International conference on parallel and distributed systems (ICPADS) (pp. 769-772). IEEE.
NLTT;Rogue Devices;Rogue devices are another threat to IoT sensors. Rogue devices are unauthorized devices that connect to the same network as the sensors and can potentially compromise the security of the network. These devices can be used to launch attacks on the network or steal sensitive data. For example, a rogue device can masquerade as a legitimate sensor and send false data to the network, causing the network to make incorrect decisions based on the false data. To mitigate this threat, it is important to implement strong access control mechanisms and regularly monitor the network for unauthorized devices. Network segmentation can also be used to isolate IoT sensors from other devices on the network, reducing the attack surface for rogue devices. Additionally, sensors should be designed with secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access and data tampering.;Agyemang, J.O., Kponyo, J.J., Klogo, G.S. and Boateng, J.O., 2020. Lightweight rogue access point detection algorithm for WiFi-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Internet of Things, 11, p.100200.
NLTT;Packet Injection;Packet injection is a type of network layer threat to IoT sensors, where an attacker sends malicious packets into the network with the intention of disrupting or manipulating the communication between the IoT devices and the network. The attacker can inject packets with false information, modify existing packets, or even create completely new packets to send to the IoT sensors. This can lead to a range of security issues, such as unauthorized access to the IoT network, data theft, and denial-of-service attacks. To protect against packet injection attacks, it is important to implement strong network security measures, such as encryption, authentication, and access control. Additionally, regularly updating the firmware and software of IoT devices can help to address known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.;Karmakar, K.K., Varadharajan, V., Nepal, S. and Tupakula, U., 2020. SDN-enabled secure IoT architecture. IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 8(8), pp.6549-6564.
ALTT;Ransomware;Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or data and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. In the context of IoT sensors, ransomware can be a significant threat if the sensors are infected with malware that encrypts the data they collect or transmit. This could result in the loss of critical data, such as environmental readings in a smart city or medical data in a healthcare facility. Additionally, if the ransom is not paid, the attacker may threaten to permanently delete the data, causing irreparable damage. To mitigate this threat, it is important to ensure that IoT sensors are protected with strong security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption. Regular backups of the data collected by the sensors can also help to minimize the impact of a ransomware attack.;Humayun, M., Jhanjhi, N.Z., Alsayat, A. and Ponnusamy, V., 2021. Internet of things and ransomware: Evolution, mitigation and prevention. Egyptian Informatics Journal, 22(1), pp.105-117.
PLTT;Power Outages;Power outages can be a significant threat to IoT sensors, as they rely on a constant source of power to function properly. If the power supply to the sensors is interrupted, they may stop collecting data, transmitting data, or performing other critical functions. This could result in a loss of critical data, such as environmental readings in a smart city or security data in a surveillance system. Additionally, power outages can also cause physical damage to the sensors, such as overheating or short-circuiting. To mitigate this threat, it is important to ensure that IoT sensors are equipped with backup power sources, such as batteries or generators. Regular maintenance and testing of these backup power sources can help to ensure that they are working properly when needed. Additionally, implementing a system to monitor the power supply to the sensors can help to detect and quickly respond to any power outages.;Al-Turjman, F. and Abujubbeh, M., 2019. IoT-enabled smart grid via SM: An overview. Future Generation Computer Systems, 96, pp.579-590.
NLTT;Packet Sniffing;Packet sniffing is a type of network security attack where an attacker intercepts and reads network traffic in order to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other confidential data. In the context of IoT sensors, packet sniffing can be a significant threat if an attacker is able to intercept and read the data transmitted by the sensors. This could result in the theft of sensitive information, such as personal or financial data, or the compromise of critical systems, such as industrial control systems or healthcare devices. To mitigate this threat, it is important to ensure that IoT sensors are protected with strong encryption and authentication mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS or AES encryption. Additionally, implementing a system to monitor the network traffic and detect any unusual activity can help to quickly identify and respond to any potential packet sniffing attacks.;Patel, B. and Shah, P., 2020. Simulation, modelling and packet sniffing facilities for IoT: A systematic analysis. International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 10(3), p.2755.
ALTT;Phishing Attacks;Phishing attacks are a common type of cyber attack that can pose a threat to IoT sensors. In a phishing attack, an attacker sends a fraudulent email or message that appears to be from a trusted source, such as a legitimate IoT device or service provider. The email or message may contain a link to a fake website that looks like the real one, and the user may be prompted to enter sensitive information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers. If an IoT sensor is compromised in a phishing attack, the attacker may be able to gain access to sensitive data or even take control of the device. This can lead to serious security and privacy risks, as well as potential damage to the device or the network it is connected to. To protect against phishing attacks, it is important to educate users on how to identify and avoid suspicious emails and messages, and to implement strong security measures, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, to protect sensitive data.;Sadiq, A., Anwar, M., Butt, R.A., Masud, F., Shahzad, M.K., Naseem, S. and Younas, M., 2021. A review of phishing attacks and countermeasures for internet of things‐based smart business applications in industry 4.0. Human behavior and emerging technologies, 3(5), pp.854-864.
NTT;Tsunamis;Tsunamis can pose a threat to IoT sensors in several ways. First, the physical destruction caused by a tsunami can damage or destroy IoT sensors, rendering them inoperable. Second, the flooding caused by a tsunami can damage the electrical components of IoT sensors, leading to malfunctions or failures. Third, the saltwater from a tsunami can corrode the sensors' metal components, further reducing their lifespan. To mitigate these risks, it is important to install IoT sensors in secure locations that are less vulnerable to natural disasters, and to use materials that can withstand the harsh conditions associated with tsunamis. Additionally, it is important to have backup systems in place that can take over in the event that primary sensors are damaged or destroyed.;Nimbargi, S.R., Hadawale, S. and Ghodke, G., 2017, December. Tsunami alert & detection system using IoT: A survey. In 2017 International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Data Science (BID) (pp. 182-184). IEEE.
