# Abstract
During the development of resilient Internet ofThings (IoT) systems, one important step is the identificationof IoT Critical Objects (Services, Devices and Resources), whichcan be defined as the most vulnerable parts of an IoT System,being more susceptible to threats. This process is prone to errorbecause it does not have pre defined standards and can be verytime consuming as it is performed manually by the analysis ofstorylines, requirements and user stories, among other challenges.One approach to automate the identification of IoT criticalobjects, and thus, reduce human error and time consumption, isto use specialized context prompts to provide information andfacilitate the identification process by chatGPT, which is a generalgenerative neural network. In this work we compare how a stateof the art fine tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER) modelfares when compared to chatGPT, one of the best generativeneural networks publicly available, on the task of identifyingIoT Critical Objects.This was performed with the developmentof a NER model, with a RoBERTa architecture, and posteriorfine tuning of the model with a specialized dataset, created withthe niche categories of the IoT Critical Objects. The dataset usedwas a large dataset with 66108 annotated sentences. Our resultsshow that chatGPTâ€™s does not surpass the performance of finetuned models enough to make them obsolete, moreover, giventhe information security needed when developing enterprise levelcommercial systems, the use of fine tuned models should still bepreferred.
